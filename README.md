# Amazon_Prices

A fun tool which helped me during thanksgiving BlackFriday to grab amazing Deals on products I was interested in. 
This script scraps the product's price on amazon and based on your affordable price, it checks if the price of the product
falls below your affordable price and emails you the link to teh amazon product on your given email.
